<h1 id="what-we-do">What We Do</h1>

<p>We raise money for Libraries projects and programs through proposals to foundations and individuals, and through the Friends of Bobst Library program. We foster public engagement with the Libraries through events such as lectures and exhibitions, and through Progressions and other donor-directed publications.</p>
