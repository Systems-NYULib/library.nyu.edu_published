<h1 id="what-we-do">What We Do</h1>

<p>We assist users of the library to find and evaluate information in the social sciences and humanities.  This can take the form of helping people at the reference desk; communicating by email, chat, or texting; or meeting in person for extended assistance.  When helping users we take advantage of the libraryâ€™s rich holdings in electronic resources, printed books and journals, and other formats.  One of our goals is teaching people how to look for information, so that they can become competent searchers themselves.</p>
